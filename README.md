# Phonebook
This is a project assigned in ECS40 - Software Development and Object-Oriented Programming.

I was responsible for writing Person.h, Person.cpp and phonebook.cpp,

# Input
The program takes a text input file (list1-8.txt) with people's last name, first name, and phone number, stores as a Person object which is then sorted into the Phonebook alphabetically by last name. 

# Output
If the text input file does not follow the correct format, the program will output either:

 - invalid characters in last name
  
 - invalid characters in first name
  
 - invalid number format


If the input files are formatted correctly, the program outputs the contents of the phonebook in the list1-8.out files.

The test files (t1-8.txt) are compared with the list1-8.out files to ensure the output is correct.
