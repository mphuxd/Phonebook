# Phonebook
This is a project assigned in ECS40 - Software Development and Object-Oriented Programming

# Input
The program takes a text input file (list1-8.txt) with people's last name, first name, and phone number, stores as a Person object which is then saved into the Phonebook alphabetically by last name. 

# Output
If the text input file does not follow the correct format, the program will output either:
  invalid characters in last name
  invalid characters in first name
  invalid number format

The program outputs the contents of the phonebook (list1-8.out).

The test files (t1-8.txt) are compared with the list1-8.out files to ensure the output is correct.
